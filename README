A suite of Ajax search widgets to interface with the Discovery Engine.

Discovery Widgets provides a set of JavaScript widgets that enable a
highly-responsive Ajax based search interface. They are comprised of
UI widgets, a page controller, and other infrastructure. The UI
widgets are built using the jQuery framework.

The page controller uses a RESTful API with regular URL parameters for
the request and expect a JSON response. Some widgets expect Discovery
Engine specific response data.

We use a pub/sub notification system for communication decoupling the
widgets from the main page controller logic. This is similar to the
system described at http://www.openajax.org but it currently uses
synchronous event callbacks.

To see the widgets in action run

    ant compress-media server

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080.
